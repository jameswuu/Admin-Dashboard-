# Admin Dashboard

### Introduction
The purpose of this project is to practice my newly acquired layout skills: using CSS Grid in combination with my existing knowledge of Flexbox to develop a structured and well-thought-out layout for a dashboard. By the end of this project, I will gain a better understanding of how to build an organized front page with both flexbox and grid.

### Expectation
I expect to build a front page consisting of a side navbar, a header, and a body containing the user's desired content.
