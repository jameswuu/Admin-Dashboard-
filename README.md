# Admin Dashboard

### Introduction
The purpose of this project is to practice my newly acquired layout skills: using CSS Grid in combination with my existing knowledge of Flexbox to develop a structured and well-thought-out layout for a dashboard. By the end of this project, I will gain a better understanding of how to build an organized front page with both flexbox and grid.

### Expectation
I expect to build a front page consisting of a side navbar, a header, and a body containing the user's desired content.

### After though
I have just completed this project, and I can finally say that I have grown a lot in the past few months. I started with excitement to learn how HTML works, gradually working my way into CSS, struggling with Flexbox, and figuring out how to align and justify content the way I desired. Now, Iâ€™ve reached a point where I can freely adjust and position items to any location I intend.

This journey of learning how to code in HTML and CSS has not been easy, but I am very glad that I stuck with it. It has eventually paid off, and I am very proud of the webpage that I created. Although it is not yet mobile responsive, I believe I am making good progress and slowly becoming a better programmer day by day! Goodbye to the intermediate HTML and CSS course!!
